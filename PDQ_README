Predict Different Quasars (PDQ)

These are IDL programs that calculate signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of potentially predictable, yet acausal, colour-difference of two near-antipodal quasars from different ground-based telescopes.  This provides the potential for a truly loophole-free Bell-test: for such quasars, simultaneous observations would be unspoiled by interference from the observers at the two sites, as those can be separated by a light-travel-time larger than the necessary photon-sampling rate of the quasars to reach that S/N.  The code simply runs the individual programs, with their settings as set in their respective parameter input tables.  There is a test dataset provided from Gemini `Alopeke/Zorro fast-framerate imaging of two stars, which is analyzed, and provides real-world calibration of the estimates.  Output test files are saved, and figures stored as JPEGs; these are as reported in the associated journal paper. The output is a list of potential quasar pairs observable with Gemini, and the best nights in the coming year to achieve the required S/N to verify they are uncorrelated.

The test data and quasar catalog are available for download from CANFAR.  

Go to: https://www.canfar.net/storage/list/AstroDataCitationDOI/CISTI.CANFAR/25.0035/data

Download the directory called Data (and all the files it contains) and file list_quasars_z_r.tar.gz, and gunzip it. That will create a directory called list_quasars_z_r.

To run, having downloaded all contents of this GitHub repository to the same directory where you created those two directories above, start IDL.  

And then, on the command-line type:
>predict_different_quasars

Hit enter.

You are welcome to use or modify this code as you wish, and if you do so please cite the associated reference paper for PDQ:
