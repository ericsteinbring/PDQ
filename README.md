# PDQ
The IDL code PDQ predicts the positions on the sky of high-redshift quasars that should provide photons that are both acausal and uncorrelated.  The best dates and times for viewing those simultaneously with Gemini `Alopeke/Zorro (for high-framerate photometry) in the coming semester are reported.
